* Add support for longnamemax filesystem flag from gocryptfs.
* Add settings for flush after write to work around timeout problem
  when using exFAT.

  without long filenames enabled. Files with too-long names are now ignored
  if long names are not enabled.
* Fix incorrect disk space reported when using reverse mode filesystem
  of whole drive.
* Add --transform (-M) option for converting full paths from encrypted
  to unencrypted and vice versa.
* Display error if user attempts to create filesystem without specifying
  a password instead of doing nothing.

v1.4.3.10, Sep 3 2021
* Noticed previous release was compiled with AES-NI instructions
  (hardware AES) support disabled.  This release fixes that.

v1.4.3.9, Aug 29 2021
* Change deny other users to be deny other sessions.  This functionality
  is now based on SessionId instead of Username.
* Add Deny Services option (deny access from SessionId 0).

v1.4.3.8, Jun 5 2021
* Make CTRL+T minimize to tray.  Make ALT+F4 work for closing app.

  is a dir.

v1.4.3.4, Nov 28 2020
* Add "enable fast mounting" setting (enabled by default).
* Make cppcryptfs and cppcryptfsctl wait forever if the named pipe

* Remove restriction that filesystems mounted with an empty NTFS direcory as the mount
  point must be mounted case-insensitive.  Also remove similar restriction that reverse-
  mode filesystems cannot be mounted using empty NTFS directory as the mount point (for
  the reason that reverse-mode filesystems must be case-sensitive).  This was done 
  because Dokany 1.2 fixes the gratuitous uppercasing of filenames that was happening
  when an empty NTFS directory is used as the mount point.
